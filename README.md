# Anime Genre Classification with SBERT + TF-IDF + Neural Networks

Welcome to the land of waifus, warriors, and wicked cool deep learning! This repo tackles the problem of multi-label genre classification for anime based on their plot synopsis using two NLP techniques: SBERT embeddings and TF-IDF vectors.

## Problem Statement

Anime often spans multiple genres (like horror-romance-comedy-action-what-is-even-going-on), so this isnâ€™t just a vanilla classification problem. It's multi-label, which means each anime can belong to multiple genres at once.

## Dataset

Anime dataset was collected from MyAnimeList using Jikan API

Final dataset `anime_dataset_preprocessed.csv`
Contains:
- `anime_id`
- `title`
- `synopsis`
- `combined` (Multilabel Genres)

## Data Preprocessing

The data preprocessing pipeline is structured in two key stages to clean, filter, and prepare the anime dataset before it goes to the model.

### Step 1: `anime_clean.ipynb` â€“ Data Cleaning & Filtering

This notebook lays the foundation by preparing the dataset structurally and semantically:

1. Column Selection & Combination

     - Retained only relevant columns: `mal_id`, `title`, `synopsis`, `genres`, `themes`.

      - Merged `genres` and `themes` into a single combined column for genre labeling.

      - Dropped the original individual `genre` columns for a cleaner structure.

2. Handling Missing Values

      - Identified and removed rows with missing or empty `synopsis`.

3. Filtering Uninformative Data

      - Removed rows with short or generic synopses (less than 20 words) and clean source attribution (e.g., "[Written by MAL Rewrite]").

      - Eliminated entries likely to be specials, OVAs, sequels, recaps, or movies, using regex filtering on keywords like "OVA", "DVD", "movie", "recap", etc.

      - Used a curated list of mal_ids to manually retain a set of specific entries (e.g., to keep entries with informative synopses).

4. Genre Standardization
      - Only certain genres were kept due to some genres not having enough data (e.g., Showbiz - 39 animes, Love Status Quo - 37 animes)
      - The genre/themes were standardized to a controlled vocabulary of 16 main categories [ "Action", "Adventure", "Comedy", "Drama", "Ecchi", 
                      "Fantasy", "Historical", 
                      "Mecha", "Music", "Mystery", 
                      "Romance", "School", "Sci-Fi", "Slice of Life", "Supernatural"]
   - Some genre names were simplified for clarity. (e.g., "Ecchi" = "Lewd", "Sci-Fi": "Science Fiction", etc.)


5. Duplicate Handling
   - Multiple steps were taken to identify and remove duplicate entries:

        1. Exact duplicate rows
        2. Duplicate synopses with different titles
        3. Near-duplicate entries

6. Saved Output

      - Result saved to `anime_dataset_cleaned.csv` â€” 10,708 unique anime entries, clean, relevant, and ready for text processing.

### Step 2: `preprocessing.ipynb` â€“ Text Normalization
Once weâ€™ve got high-quality, relevant anime entries, this stage takes over to prep the text itself:


1. Text Cleaning

   - Lowercased all text.

   - Removed digits and punctuation.

   - Tokenized sentences using NLTK.

2. Stopword Removal & Lemmatization

   - Removed common English stopwords.

   - Applied lemmatization with WordNetLemmatizer.

3. Progress Visualization

   - Used tqdm to track preprocessing progress across ~thousands of rows.

4. Final Output

    - The cleaned dataset, with normalized synopsis text, is saved as `anime_dataset_preprocessed.csv`

##  Feature Extraction
Two vectorization strategies are used:
1. SBERT Embeddings

    - Model: `all-mpnet-base-v2`

    - Provides semantic embeddings for each synopsis.

2. TF-IDF Vectorization

    - Max features: 5000

    - Stopwords removed (english)

    - More traditional bag-of-words vibe.

## Model Architecture
- Multilabel Stratified K-Fold to ensure that each fold maintains the same proportion of genre labels, preventing genre imbalance during training and evaluation â€” crucial for multi-label problems where some genres are rare.

- A simple feed-forward neural network (built with PyTorch).

- Activation: ReLU hidden layers + Sigmoid output for multi-label.

- Trained separately on both SBERT and TF-IDF representations.

## Training Setup
- Optimizer: Adam

- Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy (BCELoss)

- Metrics:

    - ROC AUC Score

    - Hamming Loss

    - F-1 Score, Recall and ROC-AUC Curves (Precision was not used due to imbalanced )
- 80-20 Train-Test Split

## Observations
- SBERT and TFIDF go toe-to-toe in performance despite SBERT having a higher (very small) Hamming Loss.

- Here's a small example of the genre prediction for 5 animes from the test set by both models:
